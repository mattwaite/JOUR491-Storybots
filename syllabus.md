**Course description:**

On the morning of March 14, Ken Schwencke rolled out of bed, logged into the LA Times content management system and published a story about an earthquake that happened three minutes prior. 

This is interesting only in the particulars: Schwencke didn't write a word of the story - no human did. The story was written by a bot. Specifically, a bot programmed by Schwencke to write a story about earthquakes minutes after they happen, so the LA Times can have something on its website about it first, and faster than any human can do the job. All Schwencke had to do was check the story to see if the bot did its job and hit publish.

Welcome to the dawning days of storybots: programs that write stories so humans don't have to. Bots now write simple stories about softball games, corporate earnings reports, the weather and, yes, earthquakes. Some of them are extraordinarily simple -- basic programming knowledge is all that's required. Others are quite sophisticated -- they rely on more complex tools to arrive at a simple story. 

This course is going to take your journalism education and combine it with some programming knowledge to produce storybots. We'll discuss the ethics, the practicality, the limits, the nature of what it means to be human and we'll make a few storybots of our own.

**Course goals:**

1. Explore how oft-derided formulaic writing can be exploited to create storybots.
2. Understand the true value of what it means to bring a human touch to stories.
3. Learn basic programming techniques to create your first storybots.
4. Run and evaluate your storybot on real world data.
5. Increase the complexity and develop a second storybots.
6. Deploy said storybots into the real world and evaluate its performance.
7. Have fun.

**Open lab hours:**

Each Friday throughout the semester, I run something called Maker Hours. It’s an open learning time where anyone who wants to learn about some digital tool or technology can come in and I’ll help. It’s in Room 27 from 1-5. You’re welcome to come learn something new outside of class, or bring your class stuff with you to get questions answered. 

**Texts:**


**Grading:**

* Showing up. It’s mandatory and not only that, it’s a really good idea. We’re going to be moving very, very fast. Miss a class, get left behind.
* Participating. A lot of this class is going to be discussion. I want you to argue. I want you to tell me I’m full of it. Debate forms better ideas. Non-participation will be graded poorly.
* Doing. We’re going to build story bots. Plural. Getting your hands dirty reflects well on you. Avoiding work does not.

Do your work, hit your deadlines, mix it up in class and you’re probably going to get a good grade. Simple.

**Notes on attendance:**

Yes, we all get sick. Yes, things happen. I don’t want you to be sick in my class any more than you want to be sick. You’ve got no fewer than five ways to get ahold of me. If you are going to miss class, tell me before class. We’ll work it out. But you have to tell me before class for me to help you.

This said: this class builds each class onto the next one. Miss a class, especially a code class, and you are behind. You’re going to be covering a lot of new material in this class. Miss one at your own peril.

**The short version on policies regarding academic integrity, diversity and students with disabilities:**

You cheat, you fail, no exceptions. 

If I’m doing something that’s keeping you from learning, tell me. Tell the Dean. Tell someone, because that’s not cool. I won’t tolerate it from myself and you shouldn’t either.

Now, the longer versions:

**Academic integrity:**

Every student must adhere to the policy on academic integrity set forth in the UNL Student Code of Conduct as outlined in the UNL Bulletin. Students who plagiarize may receive a failing grade on an assignment or for an entire course and may be reported to the Student Judicial Review Board. The work a student submits in a class must be the student's own work and must be work completed for that particular class and assignment. Students wishing to build on an old project or work on a similar project in two classes must discuss this with both professors.

Academic dishonesty includes:

* handing in another's work or part of another's work as your own.
* turning in one of your old papers (including something you wrote in high school) for a current class.
* turning in the same or similar paper for two different classes,
using notes or other study aids or otherwise obtaining another's answers for a quiz or an examination.

Anything and everything you include in your papers that comes from another source must be attributed with proper citation. That includes ideas and opinions. 

Plagiarism consists of using phrases, sentences or paragraphs from any source and republishing them without alteration or attribution. The sources include, but are not limited to, books, magazines, newspapers, television or radio reports, Web sites and other students’ papers.

**Students with disabilities:**

Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic accommodation. It is the policy of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to provide flexible and individualized accommodation to students with documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in course activities or meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services, students must be registered with the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office, 132 Canfield Administration, 472-3787 voice or TTY.

**Diversity:**

The College of Journalism and Mass Communications values diversity, in the broadest sense of the word – gender, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, income, religion, education, geographic, physical and mental ability or disability, sexual orientation. We recognize that understanding and incorporating diversity in the curriculum enables us to prepare our students for careers as professional communicators in a global society. As communicators, we understand that journalism, advertising and other forms of strategic communication must reflect society in order to be effective and reliable. We fail as journalists if we are not accurate in our written, spoken and visual reports; including diverse voices and perspectives improves our accuracy and truthfulness. In advertising, we cannot succeed if we do not understand the value of or know how to create advertising that reflects a diverse society and, thus, appeals to broader audiences.

A word of warning: This class is pretty fluid. I will move things up and back, depending on how well you’re getting things. If things change, I will update the syllabus on Blackboard and I will update the class blog.
