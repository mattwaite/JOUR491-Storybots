###Instructions###

Write a bot that reads the latest month of the latest year of the Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment rate for the US and crafts the top of a story about it. 

The data is in this directory called blsdata.

Your bot should injest the data, find the latest year and latest month and compare them to the previous year and previous month. You can find our class example [here](https://github.com/mattwaite/JOUR491-Storybots/blob/master/Examples/drunks.py). 

Print out your story -- written in journalistic style -- to the screen.
